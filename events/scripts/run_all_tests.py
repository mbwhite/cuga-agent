"""Run every test harness in order and emit ONE timestamped, commit-stamped report.

    make test-report                                   # everything
    make test-report ARGS="--skip now"                 # drop the slow phase
    GITHUB_TEST_REPO=owner/repo make test-report       # also arm the github push row

Why a runner rather than five terminal invocations: the harnesses answer different questions and have
different verdict vocabularies (pytest counts; live_e2e's pass/fail/skip; live_suite's
PASS/FAIL/XFAIL/XPASS; live_matrix's symbol grid). Reading five scrollbacks and remembering which
green means what is where mistakes come from. This captures each run verbatim, parses its own summary
line, and prints one table plus the provenance you need to trust it: UTC timestamp, commit, branch,
and whether the tree was dirty.

Each harness's raw output is kept under results/runs/<timestamp>/, so a surprising number in the
table can always be traced back to the run that produced it.

Exit code is the worst outcome across the harnesses: 0 only when nothing FAILED. Known gaps (XFAIL)
and unconfigured surfaces (SKIP) never fail the run — that is the point of having them as separate
verdicts. A pre-existing offline failure is reported and explained, not silently tolerated.
