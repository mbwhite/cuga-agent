"""ap_pieces.py — guarantee the Activepieces pieces this project depends on are INSTALLED.

Why this exists: AP CE (0.82) syncs its piece catalog from cloud.activepieces.com at boot
(PIECES_SYNC_MODE=OFFICIAL_AUTO). On a FRESH DB (after `make nuke`/`make fresh`) that first sync
can race or fail if the network is briefly down (laptop asleep / VPN off), leaving the piece table
empty or half-populated (e.g. 28 pieces). Then creating any integration connection fails with
`ENTITY_NOT_FOUND piece_metadata_not_found pieceName=@activepieces/piece-gmail` — the exact symptom.

How it works (and why): that first sync DELIVERS every piece — it just takes ~3-4 min and saturates
cloud.activepieces.com meanwhile, so racing it with our own cloud calls only gets us rate-limited.
So this script WAITS for the sync to deliver the needed pieces (returning the instant they're all
present), and only if the sync genuinely stalls does it install them directly — using PINNED versions
so the fallback never depends on the flaky cloud version API. Idempotent; acts only on what's missing.

Usage:
  python3 events/scripts/ap_pieces.py            # ensure: wait for sync, install missing as fallback
  python3 events/scripts/ap_pieces.py --status   # report only, no wait/changes (exit 1 if any missing)

Env: AP_BASE_URL / AP_EMAIL / AP_PASSWORD from .env. EVENTS_PIECES_WAIT overrides the wait (default
300s; set 0 to skip the wait and install immediately).

    #   2) the OFFICIAL_AUTO sync, delivering the same pieces in the background.
    # Then poll until all present. Common case resolves in seconds; the sync is the backstop.

    # VERSION SOURCE (why we don't just trust PINNED): AP's own sync registers each piece at its CURRENT
    # version. If our hardcoded PINNED value is OLDER than that (pin drift — e.g. schedule 0.1.17 vs a
    # synced 0.1.19), the install POST 409s `piece_metadata_already_exists` and does NOTHING useful,

    # "MISSING" past make up's wait window). So we install the EXACT version AP's live catalog reports,
