# The LOCAL events database — PostgreSQL, the same engine we deploy.
#
# WHY LOCAL IS POSTGRES NOW. Local dev used to be a SQLite file (survives everything) while Code
# Engine ran SQLite on an ephemeral disk. Two different durability stories, and the fragile one was
# the only one nobody exercised — so a pod replacement on 2026-08-05 silently deleted a cron armed
# from Slack twelve minutes earlier, and no local test could ever have caught it. Same engine
# everywhere means local testing means something.
#
#   events/scripts/events_pg.sh up      # start (idempotent) and print the DSN
#   events/scripts/events_pg.sh stop    # stop, keep the data
#   events/scripts/events_pg.sh reset   # DESTROY the data and recreate
#   events/scripts/events_pg.sh dsn     # print the DSN only
#
# The password here is a LOCAL DEV credential and is deliberately in the open — this container
# listens on localhost only and holds nothing but test flows. The deployed database uses a real
# secret from the Code Engine secret store; never reuse this one.
