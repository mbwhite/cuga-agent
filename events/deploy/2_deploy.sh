# ============================================================
# Step 2 — Deploy CUGA + the eventing service. TWO apps, ONE image.
#
#   cuga-core     CUGA itself. Serves /stream, /run and the UI. It hosts NO events layer — no
#                 triggers, no scheduler, no channel loops, and deliberately no channel secrets.
#                 It does set CUGA_EVENTS_ENABLED, which is a different question: not "host the
#                 events layer" but "take part in eventing", i.e. expose /run to the service that
#                 does. Without it there is no /run and no roster.
#   cuga-events   the eventing service. Owns triggers, the native scheduler, channels, the
#                 concierge and /invoke; executes agents by calling cuga-core's /run over HTTP.
#
# ONE IMAGE, two commands — the split is a different entrypoint, not a different build, so this
# reuses whatever ./1_build_push_image.sh already pushed. Nothing to rebuild.
#
# This is THE deployment. The old "combined" mode (events mounted onto CUGA's FastAPI app) is
# gone: the eventing layer is always its own service.
#
#   ./2_deploy.sh                 # deploy both
#   CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 YES=1 ./2_deploy.sh
#
# Known limits: single instance each (the scheduler and channel loops are process-wide singletons,
# so min=max=1).
#
# DURABLE STATE. The container filesystem is ephemeral, and it is worse than "survives a restart
# but not a revision replace" — the platform can replace the instance at any time (node drain,
# reschedule) with NO restart recorded, and the new pod starts with an empty disk. On 2026-08-05 a
# cron armed from Slack at 11:12 was gone when a new pod started at 11:24.
#
# The fix: set EVENTS_STATE_STORE to a Code Engine persistent data store (see 3_state_store.sh,
# which provisions one idempotently). This script then mounts it and points EVENTS_DB_BACKUP at it.
# The live SQLite DB deliberately stays on LOCAL disk — CE data stores are COS-backed, and SQLite
# on object storage corrupts — so the service snapshots to the mount instead (db_persist.py).
# Leave EVENTS_STATE_STORE unset and you get the old ephemeral behaviour, with a loud warning.

# 401 — an app nobody, including you, can log in to. So we check the credential is actually there

# (it returns None and the role check accepts it), so core's /api/events/admin/* proxy attaches
# GATEWAY_TOKEN on behalf of ANY anonymous caller. The events service is correctly refusing
# strangers; core was vouching for them. Turning authentication on is what makes that gate real.
#
# AUTHORIZATION (role checks) stays OFF deliberately. jwt_validator._extract_roles reads a
# top-level `roles` claim or `realm_access.roles`; IBM App ID emits neither by default, so
# flipping it on would authenticate everyone and then 403 them out of every Manage route.
