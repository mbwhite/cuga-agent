# ============================================================
# Provision DURABLE STATE for the eventing service — idempotent.
#
# WHY. The Code Engine container filesystem is ephemeral. The platform can replace the instance at
# any time (new revision, node drain, reschedule) and the new pod starts with an EMPTY disk — with
# no restart recorded, so `ibmcloud ce app get` still shows "Restarts: 0". Every armed flow is gone.
# Observed 2026-08-05: a cron armed from Slack at 11:12 vanished when a new pod started at 11:24.
#
# WHAT THIS CREATES (all reusable, all deletable — see TEARDOWN at the bottom):
#   1. a COS bucket                     $BUCKET        (in the $COS_INSTANCE service instance)
#   2. HMAC service credentials         $CREDS_NAME    (so Code Engine can mount the bucket)
#   3. a Code Engine secret             $SECRET_NAME   (holds those credentials)
#   4. a Code Engine persistent store   $STORE_NAME    (binds the bucket to the project)
#
# It creates nothing that already exists, and prints a plan before touching anything.
#
#   ./3_state_store.sh              # show the plan, then ask
#   YES=1 ./3_state_store.sh        # non-interactive
#
# THEN: EVENTS_STATE_STORE=$STORE_NAME ./2_deploy.sh
#
# NOTE ON THE DESIGN. The store is COS-backed (object storage). SQLite must NOT run on it — no
# POSIX locking, whole-object rewrites, corruption. So the live DB stays on local disk and the
# service snapshots to the mount (src/cuga/backend/events/db_persist.py). This is correct for the
# single writer we deploy (min=max=1). Multiple replicas need Postgres — see the events documentation repository.

# The three guards every other script in this directory calls. This one sourced config.sh and then

#
#   admin_guard  — this script creates BILLABLE COS resources and rotates an HMAC service key, so
#                  it is exactly the path CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 exists to gate. Passed `-y` because the
#                  script has its OWN confirmation prompt below; without it you answer twice.
#   require_login — fail with instructions rather than a raw ibmcloud error.
#   ce_target    — WITHOUT THIS the `ibmcloud ce secret create` and `ibmcloud ce pds create` calls
#                  below act on whatever project happens to be selected. Create the store in the
#                  wrong project and 2_deploy.sh — which does call ce_target — reports "does not
#                  exist in this project" and exits, with nothing to suggest the resource was made
#                  somewhere else entirely. It also has to run BEFORE $BUCKET is computed, since
#                  that reads the account GUID from the current target.
