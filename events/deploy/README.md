# Deploy CUGA (events, no Activepieces) to IBM Code Engine

**Two Code Engine apps, one image, one managed database:**

| App | Is | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `cuga-core` | vanilla CUGA — **the door** (`/run`, `/stream`, `/run/agents`, the Studio UI) | 7860 |
| `cuga-events-svc` | the eventing service — channel adapters, concierge, scheduler, `/invoke` | 8100 |
| `cuga-events-pg` | **IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL** — where armed flows live | — |

On CE the app routes _are_ the public URLs, so there is no tunnel. The registry connects out to the
already-deployed `cuga-apps-mcp-*` tool servers; the only external dependencies are the **LLM**,
those (public, keyless) MCP routes, and the database.

The old single-app "combined" mode (`cuga start demo --events`) is **gone** — there is one topology.

Mirrors the routing team's CE conventions (same account/region/project/registry as
VAKRA). Admin-gated; nothing runs without `CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1`.

## Fresh machine → deployed (read this before the first deploy)

Three things bite a brand-new checkout, and only the first one fails loudly.

**1. Populate `.env` FIRST.** `make_env_ce.sh` builds the Code Engine secret *from your local
`.env`* — it does not prompt, and it does not warn about keys you never set. A clone with an empty
`.env` produces a secret missing the LLM credentials and every channel token, and the deploy
succeeds anyway. Fill it in from the annotated [`.env.events.example`](../../.env.events.example) at
the repo root (every key the events layer reads, grouped by connector), then run `./make_env_ce.sh`.

**2. Run `./4_postgres.sh` BEFORE `./2_deploy.sh` on a new project.** `2_deploy.sh` branches on
whether `EVENTS_DB` is already in the CE secret: present → managed PostgreSQL; absent → it falls
back to `EVENTS_DB=/app/.cuga/events.db`, which is **ephemeral container storage**. Every armed flow
is then lost on the next instance replace. `4_postgres.sh` is idempotent: it reuses an existing
database instance rather than provisioning a second one.

> **The two keys that used to exist in only one place.** The DSN (`EVENTS_DB`) and its CA
> (`EVENTS_DB_CA_B64`) are provisioned in the cloud, not typed into `.env`. They used to be written
> *only* into the live CE secret, which was survivable by accident: `ibmcloud ce secret update`
> **merges**, so a normal redeploy kept them. But `teardown.sh WIPE_SECRET=1` and a fresh project
> both take the `secret create` path, which writes only what `.env.ce` contains — and `.env.ce` did

>
> Fixed on both ends. `4_postgres.sh` now writes both keys into `.env.ce` as well as the secret, and

>
> `2_deploy.sh` also runs a **preflight** before touching the secret, because this class of failure
> is invisible afterwards — on an existing project the merge quietly supplies whatever is missing.
> It refuses to deploy without `GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `AGENT_SETTING_CONFIG`, or a CA for a `verify-full`
> DSN, and warns on `EVENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` / `CUGA_SECRET_KEY`.

**2b. `ibmcloud ce secret get` PRINTS EVERY VALUE.** It is not a listing command — the human-readable
form base64-encodes them and `--output json` returns them in the clear. Base64 is not encryption;
that output *is* the secret, and it should not go into a terminal you are sharing, a bug report, or
a scrollback you keep. To check what a secret contains, use the key-name-only helper:

```bash
source config.sh && secret_key_names cuga-events-secrets
```

**3. The route is stable — you never have to guess it.** Code Engine derives it from the app name
and the project subdomain, both fixed, so redeploying under the same names gives the same URL:

```
https://<app-name>.<project-subdomain>.<region>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud
```

Every `make ce-deploy` prints both routes when it finishes, and writes them to the gitignored
`.ce_urls.env`. To read them later: **`make ce-url`**. The live URLs are deliberately absent from
this repo — it is open source, and the deployment holds real channel credentials.

---

## Prerequisites
- `ibmcloud` CLI + the `code-engine` plugin (`ibmcloud plugin install code-engine`).
- Logged in to the routing account: **`ibmcloud login --sso`** → pick region `us-east`.
- A registry secret in the CE project (default `icr-secret-1`) — already present if
  the cuga-apps-mcp servers deploy there. If not, `1_build_push_image.sh` prints how.
- Your local `../../.env` with the LLM + channel creds (used to build the CE secret).

## Make targets (the easy path)

Every deploy/ops/test step has a `make` target (run from the repo root). They mirror
the scripts below and read the deployed URL from `events/deploy/.ce_urls.env`. **Local
targets are unchanged; these are the CE parallels — `[CE]` in `make help`.**

| Target | Does |
|---|---|
| `make ce-build` | cloud buildrun → ICR (`1_build_push_image.sh`) |
| `make ce-deploy` | deploy/redeploy BOTH apps (supervisor + the 8-agent `events/examples/rosters/default.yaml`; `CE_ROSTER=…` to change) |
| `make ce-smoke` | capability report + channels + a web-chat turn (`3_smoke.py`) |
| **`make test-e2e-ce`** | **the CE parallel of `make test-e2e`** — real channel + fire e2e against the deployed app |
| `make ce-status` | deploy status + the live capability report |
| `make ce-logs` | container logs — `FOLLOW=1` to stream · `GREP=telegram` to filter · `TAIL=n` |
| `make ce-url` | print the deployed URL |
| `make ce-appid` | **once**: provision App ID + wire OIDC login (`5_appid.sh`; idempotent) |
| `make ce-teardown` | delete both apps (keeps image, registry secret, **and the database**) |

`test-e2e-ce` runs the **same harness** as `test-e2e`, only with `EVENTS_SERVER_URL`
pointed at the CE route; channel creds + `GATEWAY_TOKEN` come from your `.env` (they
must match the deployed secret). First-time setup still needs `make_env_ce.sh` (below).

**Login vs public-route.** `ce-smoke` and `test-e2e-ce` hit the app's **public route** — no
`ibmcloud` login needed. `ce-status` and `ce-logs` use the CE **control plane**, so they need
`ibmcloud login` first (region/group are `CE_REGION`/`CE_GROUP`, default `us-east`/`routing` — the
targets run `ibmcloud target -r … -g …` before selecting the project; override on the CLI). If you're
not logged in, `ce-status` says so plainly.

**What `test-e2e-ce` proves.** Arm **and FIRE** for real: all four channels round-trip, and native
cron/poll actually fire on the in-process scheduler and return a live agent answer (answer *content*
is not graded — the fire is what's tested). A channel with no token is SKIPPED and named; the harness
is no-AP-aware (AP-only checks skip, never fail). A synthetic-web delivery failure does not count
against a fire.

**Verify the background loops.** The direct channel loops (Telegram long-poll, Discord Gateway) and
the native scheduler only run if the events-background launcher fires at boot — confirm with
`make ce-logs GREP=launched` → `events: launched N background task(s)`. (That launcher was once
dropped in a merge, silently breaking Telegram/Discord + cron/poll; it's restored in
`src/cuga/backend/server/main.py`.)

## The events database (do this ONCE, before the first deploy)

Armed flows live in PostgreSQL. **This is not optional infrastructure** — without it, Code Engine
replacing the instance (a new revision, a node drain, a reschedule) silently deletes every armed
flow, with *no restart recorded*. On 2026-08-05 a cron armed from Slack at 11:12 was gone when a new
pod started at 11:24, and `ibmcloud ce app get` still read `Restarts: 0` throughout.

```bash
cd events/deploy
YES=1 ./4_postgres.sh          # provisions the DB + credentials, writes the DSN + CA into BOTH
                               # the CE secret and .env.ce (so a from-scratch deploy can rebuild)
```

It creates an IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL instance (**billable**; 8 GB RAM is the enforced
minimum), service credentials, and writes `EVENTS_DB` + `EVENTS_DB_CA_B64` into the existing
`cuga-events-secrets` — with `secret update`, so your bot tokens and watsonx keys are preserved.
`2_deploy.sh` then detects `EVENTS_DB` in the secret and wires it automatically.

- **Same engine as local dev** (`make pg`), which is the point: local testing now exercises the
  storage path that actually ships.
- **TLS is `verify-full`** — the CA rides in the secret as `EVENTS_DB_CA_B64` and is written to a
  0600 file at first connect. Do not "fix" a TLS error by dropping to `sslmode=require`; that keeps
  encryption but stops verifying the peer.
- **Cheaper fallback** if you don't want a managed DB: `./3_state_store.sh` keeps SQLite on local
  disk and snapshots it to a COS-backed data store. Single-writer, whole-file snapshots — it works,
  but it does not scale and local ≠ cloud again.
- Teardown commands are printed at the end of the script.

## Sequence (the scripts underneath)
```bash
cd events/deploy
./make_env_ce.sh                        # .env.ce from ../../.env (gitignored, chmod 600)
YES=1 ./4_postgres.sh                   # ONCE: the events database (see above)
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 ./5_appid.sh            # ONCE: OIDC login (see "Login" below) — needs cuga-core's URL

CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 ./1_build_push_image.sh # cloud buildrun -> icr.io/.../cuga-events:latest (~10-20 min)
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 ./2_deploy.sh           # create BOTH apps; prints the routes + Slack step
python 3_smoke.py                       # capability report + channels + a web-chat turn
```
Redeploy after a code change: re-run 1 then 2. Change only env/roster (no rebuild): re-run 2 alone.
Tear down the apps: `CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 ./teardown.sh` (leaves the database intact).

### The exact commands the live deploy used (copy-paste to reproduce)
```bash
cd events/deploy
./make_env_ce.sh                                    # .env.ce from ../../.env
YES=1 ./4_postgres.sh                               # once — skips anything already there
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 YES=1 ./1_build_push_image.sh       # ~10-20 min
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 YES=1 ./2_deploy.sh                 # supervisor roster is ON by default
python 3_smoke.py
```
`YES=1` skips the interactive "Proceed? [y/N]" confirm (for automation); drop it to
be prompted. `CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1` is the required admin opt-in on every step.

## Login (OIDC via IBM App ID) — `5_appid.sh`

**Run it once, not every deploy.** The App ID instance and its registered application are
long-lived; the client id and secret live in `.env` and reach Code Engine through
`make_env_ce.sh`. Re-registering mints a **new secret and invalidates the old one**, which is why
this is a separate script and not a step inside `2_deploy.sh`.

```bash
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 ./5_appid.sh                  # create or reuse — safe to re-run
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 RECREATE_APP=1 ./5_appid.sh   # force a NEW client secret (rotation)
```

Idempotent by default: an existing instance is reused, and an existing application of the same
name is reused **with its current credentials**. It needs `cuga-core` to already exist (it reads
the route to build the redirect URI), so on a brand-new project deploy first, then run this, then
re-run `make_env_ce.sh && ./2_deploy.sh` to turn login on.

What it configures:

| Step | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| App ID instance | Lite plan = free. `APPID_PLAN=graduated-tier` for volume. |
| Application | Yields `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, the discovery URL. |
| Redirect URIs | Must match `OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` **exactly** or App ID refuses the callback. |
| **IdP lockdown** | **The one you cannot skip** — see below. |
| Writes 4 keys to `.env` | `make_env_ce.sh`'s `CORE_ONLY` list puts them in **cuga-core's secret only**. |

> ### ⚠ A fresh App ID instance has TWO ways in that you did not intend
> **1. Public self-signup.** Cloud Directory ships with `signupEnabled: true`, so anyone on the
> internet can register an account and log in.
>
> **2. Anonymous access.** Separate, and easy to miss because disabling signup does not touch it.
> `anonymousAccess` is enabled by default, and a plain GET with `&idp=appid_anon` returns a real
> authorization code with **no account and no password** — reproduced against this instance before
> it was closed. A user sent to CUGA's login page can append that parameter to the authorization
> URL CUGA redirected them to; they already hold a `state` and PKCE challenge CUGA issued, so the
> callback validates and they are inside. While authorization is off, that is full access.
>
> Turn authentication on against an untouched instance and you get a deployment that looks secured
> and is not. `5_appid.sh` closes both, and deactivates the social providers that are "active" with
> empty config. Accounts become admin-created only:
> *IBM Cloud > Resource list > `cuga-appid` > Cloud Directory > Users > Add user.*
> That user creation is the one manual step; everything else is scripted.

**The redirect URI is a frontend page, not the callback route.** Pointing it at `/auth/callback`
looks right and fails at runtime: that route reads a **JSON body**, so it is called by the SPA,
not the IdP. App ID redirects the browser (GET) to a React route, `App.tsx` reads `code`/`state`
off the query string and POSTs them as JSON. So the redirect target is `/manage`.

**Why OIDC goes to cuga-core only.** The events service has no session awareness at all — it
authenticates callers with `X-Gateway-Token`. It is also a different origin, and the session
cookie is `SameSite=Lax`, so a browser session can never reach it directly. That is why admin
calls are proxied through core and why `make_env_ce.sh` has a `CORE_ONLY` list.

### Authentication is what closes the admin hole

`2_deploy.sh` gates `DYNACONF_AUTH__ENABLED` on `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` actually being in the core
secret, because enabling auth without the four keys is a **hard brick**: `get_oidc_client()`
returns `None`, `/auth/login` answers 503, and every `require_auth` route answers 401 — nobody,
including you, can log in. When it does enable auth it also sets `DYNACONF_AUTH__REQUIRE_HTTPS=true`
— required on Code Engine, or the session cookie is issued without `Secure` and the `SameSite=None`
state cookie is rejected by the browser. Watch for one of these lines:

```
auth: OIDC login ENABLED (authorization/roles off — see the note above)
⚠ auth: DISABLED — no OIDC_CLIENT_ID in cuga-core-secrets
```

With auth **off**, `require_manage_access` is a pass-through, so core's `/api/events/admin/*`
proxy attaches `GATEWAY_TOKEN` on behalf of **any anonymous caller** — the events service
correctly refuses strangers while core vouches for them. Turning authentication on is what makes
that gate real. Verify:

```bash
curl -s $CORE_URL/api/auth/config                     # -> {"enabled":true,...}
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST \
     $CORE_URL/api/events/admin/users                 # -> 401  (was 200)
```

**Authorization (roles) stays OFF deliberately — one step still missing.**
`jwt_validator._extract_roles` reads a top-level `roles` claim or `realm_access.roles`, and App ID
emits neither by default. `5_appid.sh` now maps `roles → roles` into both tokens, which is the
half that needed doing in App ID's config. What remains is data, and it is **manual**:

1. Define roles named exactly `ServiceOwner`, `ServiceAdmin`, `ServiceUser` — the names in
   `settings.toml` under `[auth] manage_roles` / `chat_roles`.
   *App ID > Profiles and roles > Roles.* Roles are built from application scopes, so add scopes
   to the `cuga-core` application first.
2. Assign a role to every user who should have access.
3. Only then set `DYNACONF_AUTH__AUTHORIZATION_ENABLED=true`.

Flip the flag before step 2 and every authenticated user is **403'd out of all ~37 Manage
routes** — including you. Until then, authentication alone is the control: everyone who can log
in can do everything, which is safe only because signup and anonymous access are both off and
accounts are admin-created.

Channels and `test-e2e-ce` are unaffected by any of this — they authenticate with
`X-Gateway-Token`, not sessions.

### `2_deploy.sh` checks two things that fail SILENTLY

Both of these have shipped broken. Neither raises an error at runtime — they just make every answer
quietly worse, so the script asserts them while you are still watching:

```
== post-deploy checks ==
  ✓ roster: 9 agents on cuga-core
  ✓ durability: PostgreSQL — an instance replace is a non-event
```

- **roster: 1 agent** → `CUGA_SUPERVISOR_ROSTER` never reached `cuga-core`, so every fired flow runs
  the bare default agent with no sub-agents and no scoped tools. (`CE_EVENTS_SUPERVISOR` used to
  default to off, which caused exactly this; it now defaults to **on**.)
- **durability: false** → armed flows will be lost on the next instance replace. Run `./4_postgres.sh`.

## How environment variables get set (three sources)

The container's env comes from three places, applied in this order — **last wins**:

| # | Source | Set at | Holds | Change it by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Dockerfile `ENV`** ([Dockerfile.events](Dockerfile.events)) | **build time** | rarely-changing non-secret defaults: `CUGA_HOST=0.0.0.0`, `DYNACONF_SERVER_PORTS__DEMO=7860`, `MCP_SERVERS_FILE`, `EVENTS_SCHEDULER=native`, the direct channel backends | edit the Dockerfile → rebuild (step 1) |
| 2 | **CE secret** `cuga-events-secrets` via `--env-from-secret` | **deploy time** (from `.env.ce`) | credentials + config-from-.env: `AGENT_SETTING_CONFIG`, `WATSONX_*`, `LLM_*`, `GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `EVENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY`, `CUGA_SECRET_KEY`, the channel tokens — **plus** the cloud-provisioned `EVENTS_DB` + `EVENTS_DB_CA_B64`, which `make_env_ce.sh` carries forward rather than reading from `.env` | edit `.env` → `./make_env_ce.sh` → step 2 |
| 3 | **Deploy-time `--env` literals** ([2_deploy.sh](2_deploy.sh)) | **deploy time** | per-deploy runtime knobs: `EVENTS_WORKER_BACKEND`, `EVENTS_SCHEDULER`, the backends, `MCP_SERVERS_FILE`, `CUGA_SUPERVISOR_ROSTER` (on cuga-core), `DEPLOY_REV`, and **`EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL`** (see below) | env vars on the `2_deploy.sh` command line, or edit the script |

Precedence: a deploy-time `--env` (source 3) **overrides** the same key baked into the
image (source 1). That's why `2_deploy.sh` re-passes `EVENTS_SCHEDULER=native`,
the backends, and `MCP_SERVERS_FILE` even though the Dockerfile already bakes them —
the deploy-time value is the source of truth, and the image `ENV` is just a sane
default if someone runs the container by hand. **Secrets are injected as env at
runtime** via `--env-from-secret` — never on a command line, never in the image,
never in git.

## The public URL — the chicken-and-egg, explained

**Your exact question:** the route only exists *after* the app is created, so how does
`EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL` get set ahead of time? It doesn't — it's set in a **second pass in
the same script run** ([2_deploy.sh](2_deploy.sh)):

```
1. ce app create   …  (NO EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL)      → CE assigns the route
2. ce app get --output url                         → read the now-known route
3. ce app update --env EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL=<route>   → CE rolls a NEW revision
```

So yes — **"update and refresh."** Step 3 changes the env var, and **Code Engine
automatically rolls out a new revision** (~30-60s brief re-boot) with the value baked
in. You never restart anything by hand.

What that means in practice:
- **For ~1-2 min between create and the update-revision going live**, the capability
  report shows `✗ no EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL`. Expected; it self-heals. Running `3_smoke.py`
  *after* the script finishes shows `✓ public URL set`.
- **The route is deterministic and stable:**
  `https://<app-name>.<project-hash>.<region>.codeengine.appdomain.cloud`. The
  `<project-hash>` is fixed per CE project and the app name never changes — so **every
  redeploy yields the identical URL** (even a delete/recreate keeps the name → keeps
  the URL). That's why Slack's Request URL, once pointed at the route, never needs
  re-pointing.
- **Is it strictly required?** For Slack *inbound* signature verification, no — only
  `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` matters. `EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL` drives OAuth callbacks,
  self-referential links, and an honest capability report. The two-pass is about
  correctness, not a hard requirement for chat.
- **Want to skip the second pass?** Because the URL is stable, on a *redeploy* you can
  set it up front by passing `--env EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL=https://cuga-events.<hash>.us-east.codeengine.appdomain.cloud`
  to the create. The script deliberately doesn't hardcode the hash — the
  create→read→update pattern works even on the very first deploy, when the hash is
  still unknown.

## What works on CE in the no-AP route
| Integration | On CE (no-AP) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Web chat** | ✅ auto | in-process |
| **Telegram** | ✅ auto at boot | long-poll (outbound); token in the secret |
| **Discord** | ✅ auto at boot | Gateway WebSocket (outbound); token in the secret |
| **Webhook** | ✅ | CE route is public; set `EVENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY` |
| **Slack** | ✅ one manual step | point the Slack app's Request URL at `<route>/api/events/slack/events` — the CE route replaces the local tunnel |
| **cron / poll** | ✅ | native scheduler in-process (state is ephemeral — see below) |
| **Gmail · GitHub · Box · Calendar · Pinterest push** | ❌ by design | AP-only triggers; no AP = off. Deploy AP separately to enable. |

**Slack doesn't need a tunnel on CE** — locally it needs ngrok because Slack POSTs
inbound to localhost; on CE the platform route is already public.

## The load-bearing CE caveats
- **`--min-scale 1 --max-scale 1` (single, always-warm).** Telegram long-poll, the
  Discord Gateway, and the native scheduler are persistent *single-owner* loops —
  more than one instance double-processes events, and scale-to-zero kills the loops.
  This is a correctness constraint, not a cost knob.
- **State is durable — armed flows live in PostgreSQL** (`EVENTS_DB`), so an instance
  replace is a non-event. The container disk is still ephemeral, which is why nothing
  that must survive may be written to it. *(Conversation memory in the SQLite
  checkpointer is the remaining exception and is still lost on redeploy.)*
- **Remote MCP servers scale to zero** → the first tool call after idle has cold-start
  lag. Warm them before a demo.
- **`REAL` is not the same type in SQLite and Postgres.** SQLite's `REAL` is an 8-byte
  double; Postgres's is `float4`, ~7 significant digits. Every timestamp here is a Unix
  epoch (10 digits), so on Postgres they were silently rounded to a **~100-second grid**
  — a "1 minute" cron drifted onto that grid, the Runs log's times were wrong by up to
  ±50s, and the web mailbox's `since` cursor skipped messages that shared a bucket.
  `db._to_pg_types` now emits `DOUBLE PRECISION`, and `widen_real_columns()` repairs a
  database an older build already created (it logs `widened N float4 column(s)` once at
  boot). **The offline suite cannot catch this class of bug** — SQLite is unaffected —
  so schema changes want a run of `make test-pg` against a real PostgreSQL.

## Agent model (a `--env` change, no rebuild)
The agent model is pure env, so switching is just a **re-run of step 2** (the image
never changes):

```bash
# script default — supervisor ON over the 8-agent core roster
# (CE_EVENTS_SUPERVISOR defaults to 1 and CE_ROSTER to events/examples/rosters/default.yaml,
#  so this is exactly what `make ce-deploy` runs and what the live deploy uses)
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 ./2_deploy.sh

# the big 27-agent grab-bag roster instead
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 CE_ROSTER=events/examples/rosters/supervisor_agents_full.yaml ./2_deploy.sh

# a focused, curated roster
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 CE_ROSTER=events/examples/rosters/no_ap_research_desk.yaml ./2_deploy.sh

# classic single generalist — no roster at all (opt OUT explicitly)
CUGA_CE_ADMIN=1 CE_EVENTS_SUPERVISOR=0 ./2_deploy.sh
```
`CE_EVENTS_SUPERVISOR` is the gate that makes the deploy pass a roster at all, and it **defaults to
1**. It used to default to off, and that was a trap: a plain `./2_deploy.sh` produced a CUGA whose
`/run/agents` reported one agent, so every fired flow ran as the bare default with no sub-agents and
no scoped tools — nothing errored, the answers were just quietly worse.

`CE_ROSTER` sets `CUGA_SUPERVISOR_ROSTER` on **cuga-core** (see [2_deploy.sh](2_deploy.sh) —
`EVENTS_SUPERVISOR` itself is inert and is deliberately not passed). Every roster under
`events/examples/rosters/` is baked into the image, so any of them is available without a rebuild.
The default and every `no_ap_*.yaml` run with zero AP; the `ap_*` rosters only light up their SaaS
triggers once Activepieces is deployed.

## Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config.sh` | account/region/project/registry + app sizing + admin guard |
| `Dockerfile.events` | the one image both apps run; `2_deploy.sh` picks the command per app |
| `make_env_ce.sh` | build the gitignored `.env.ce` from your local `.env` — copies the allow-listed keys, **carries forward** the cloud-provisioned `EVENTS_DB` + `EVENTS_DB_CA_B64` |
| `1_build_push_image.sh` | cloud buildrun → ICR |
| `2_deploy.sh` | create the CE secret + app; set `EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL` |
| `3_smoke.py` | capability report + channels + a web-chat probe |
| `teardown.sh` | delete the app (optionally the secret) |
| `make_env_ce.sh` | **the** way to build the CE secrets — generates BOTH `.env.ce` (events) and `.env.ce.core` (core) from `../../.env`; both gitignored. There is no hand-edited template: the annotated key list lives in the repo-root `.env.events.example`. |
