# Provision the events DATABASE — IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL. Idempotent.
#
# WHY POSTGRES AND NOT THE COS SNAPSHOT (3_state_store.sh).
# Local dev and the deployment must run the SAME storage engine, or local testing proves nothing
# about production. That is not theoretical: on 2026-08-05 a cron armed from Slack vanished twelve
# minutes later when Code Engine replaced the instance, and no local test could have caught it
# because locally the events DB was a SQLite file that survives everything.
#
# With Postgres, durability is a property of the database. No mount, no snapshot loop, no restore
# step, no "did the background task run" question — a new pod connects and the flows are there.
# It also unblocks multi-replica later, which single-writer SQLite never can.
#
# WHAT THIS CREATES (billable — see TEARDOWN):
#   1. a Databases for PostgreSQL instance   $PG_INSTANCE
#   2. service credentials                   $PG_CREDS
#   3. the DSN written into the Code Engine secret $SECRET_NAME as EVENTS_DB
#      (a DSN carries a password, so it must be a secret, never a literal --env)
#
#   ./4_postgres.sh              # plan, then ask
#   YES=1 ./4_postgres.sh        # non-interactive
#
# THEN: ./2_deploy.sh    (it detects EVENTS_DB in the secret and skips the COS path entirely)
