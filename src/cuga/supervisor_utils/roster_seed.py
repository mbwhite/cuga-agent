"""Import a roster YAML into the agent config store, so there is ONE runtime path.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
There were two ways to describe "a supervisor and its sub-agents":

    a roster YAML  → load_supervisor_config()          → used by /run   (events)
    the config DB  → build_agents_from_stored_subagents() → used by /stream (#433)

Both already ended in the same builder, so nothing was duplicated in the *code* — but the two
config SOURCES meant `/run` and the Manage UI could disagree about what the roster is, and the
9 events agents were invisible in a UI that lists every other agent.

This collapses that. The store is the only thing read at runtime; the YAML is an import format,
exactly like the JSON import the Manage UI already has. A deployment still boots from a file it
ships in the image — set ``CUGA_SUPERVISOR_ROSTER`` and the roster is seeded before the first
request — but nothing parses YAML to answer a request.

OWNERSHIP RULE
--------------
An agent NAMED IN THE YAML is owned by the YAML *until a human edits it*. Seeding rewrites it on
every boot, so the file stays the reviewed source of truth and a container replace restores it —
but only while nobody has changed it in Manage. Each seeded record carries a hash of what the
roster wrote (``_roster_seed_hash``); if the stored config no longer matches that hash, somebody
edited it and seeding leaves it alone.

Without that, every restart silently reverted the Manage UI to the YAML, and the edit looked like
it had never been saved. An agent added through the UI has an id the YAML never mentions, so
seeding never touches it either way.

That covers each agent's own record, but NOT its membership of the supervisor, which lives in the
supervisor's config — a record the YAML does own and does rewrite. Seeding the file's list verbatim
dropped UI-added sub-agents on every restart: still in the registry, no longer in the supervisor,
reachable by nobody.

`_partition_prior` keeps them, and uses ROSTER_OWNED_KEY to stay honest in the other direction: a
ref the file no longer names is kept only if the UI put it there. An agent the roster itself dropped
is removed, so the file still owns its own entries and stale agents cannot accumulate.

IDEMPOTENCE
-----------
``save_config`` bumps to ``max(version) + 1`` on every call, so naive re-seeding would add a
version on every container restart. We compare against the published config first and use
``update_published_config_at_version`` to rewrite in place, so a restart that changes nothing
writes nothing.
