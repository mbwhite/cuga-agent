"""``POST /run`` and ``GET /run/agents`` — CUGA's machine seam, plus the supervisor roster.

Extracted from ``server/main.py`` rather than grown inside it, following the same shape as
``a2a.runner.build_a2a_router_for_settings``: this module owns the routes and their state, and
``main.py`` keeps one ``include_router`` call.

``/run`` is the non-streaming form of ``/stream``: one request, one JSON answer.

**Without a roster** it drives the SAME ``event_stream`` generator in-process, so knowledge,
history, citations, policies and HITL behave identically — only the output adapter differs.

**With a roster loaded it is NOT the same graph**, and the difference is worth stating plainly
rather than discovering:

  * it calls ``supervisor.invoke``, which does not take attachments, a resume payload, or HITL —
    those are silently absent, not deferred;
  * ``?agent=`` is ADVISORY. There is no public API on ``CugaSupervisor`` to invoke a named
    sub-agent, so the name is expressed as an instruction in the prompt and the model is free to
    ignore it. A webhook pinned to a specialist may be answered by a different one.

Routing to a named sub-agent properly needs a real API on the supervisor; until that exists, do not
read ``?agent=`` as a guarantee.

``event_stream`` and the default user id are INJECTED by :func:`build_run_router` rather than
imported from ``main``, which would be a cycle (``main`` imports this module to mount it).
