"""Direct Box integration — talks to Box's own API with a token, bypassing Activepieces.

Same move as ``slack_direct``: Box's REST API accepts a bearer token directly, so we don't need AP's
OAuth2 connection (the wall that blocked the AP Box path — AP insists on doing the code-exchange
itself and refuses a pre-obtained dev/access token) NOR AP's Box ``new_file`` webhook (which needs a
paid Box app with a saved redirect URI + ``manage_webhook``). Combined with direct-channel delivery
(``delivery.send_direct``), this gives a fully AP-free resume watcher:

    Box folder poll (this module) ▸ /invoke(resume_judge) ▸ Slack/Gmail delivery.

Token: ``BOX_DEV_TOKEN`` (a 60-min Box developer token — grab a fresh one from the Box dev console;
no OAuth app/redirect-URI needed) or, later, a stored OAuth access token via ``EVENTS_BOX_TOKEN``.

This is a POLLING trigger (Box has no free push): CUGA lists a folder's items and fires on files
whose ``created_at`` is newer than the last poll. Emit-on-change is caller-tracked (``since``).

# Server-tracked per-folder "last created_at seen" — a STANDING scheduled poll must fire only on

# file in the folder re-fires as if it were new.
#
# It therefore lives in the EVENTS DATABASE, not a file. It used to be `.box_since.json`, a relative
# path, and nothing in the Code Engine deploy set EVENTS_BOX_SINCE_FILE or mounted a volume — with
# Postgres configured the deploy runs "no mount, no snapshots" — so the watermark sat on the
# container's ephemeral disk and an instance replace silently re-fired the whole folder. Exactly the
# durability gap the Postgres move was meant to close, in the one place that was still a file.

# The file remains the fallback for a dev box with no EVENTS_DB, which keeps local behaviour and the

# 60s opened two PostgreSQL connections a minute and dropped both on the floor — the server runs
# out of connection slots long before anything here notices, and it takes the rest of the events
# layer down with it, because they share the database. It also re-ran CREATE TABLE every time.
