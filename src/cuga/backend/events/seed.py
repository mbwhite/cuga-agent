"""Seed pre-built agents — what a BUILDER creates at design time.

In the refined model the concierge NEVER creates agents; a builder does (skill + MCP tools +
policies + the channels/integrations the agent may use). Until the builder UI lands, this module
seeds a demo fleet so the runtime router (answer-now / reuse-or-create-flow / decline) has agents
to work with — and so tests/UI have a realistic starting point.

Each agent declares:
  - ``mcp_servers``   — its tools (from mcp_catalog; loaded via the CUGA registry).
  - ``channels``      — where it can converse (web / telegram / …).
  - ``integrations``  — apps it can watch/act on, each with credential OWNERSHIP:
        'shared'   → the builder connects a service account once.
        'per-user' → each chatting user logs in with their own (OAuth/token) at first use.

Enable with ``EVENTS_SEED_AGENTS=1`` (main.py seeds on startup). Idempotent (upsert by name).
