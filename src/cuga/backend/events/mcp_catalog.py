"""The `cuga_*` MCP server catalog — auto-registration by name.

A CONVENIENCE, NOT AN ALLOW-LIST. These seven are wired by name so the demos work out of the box;
they are not the set of servers an agent may use. Anything registered in the CUGA registry can be
named by a `backend="cuga"` agent (CUGA resolves it there, and this process never sees it), and a
`backend="react"` agent can carry its own endpoint as ``{"name": …, "url": …}``. This module used
to be enforced as a closed list by the agent-editor validator, which meant nobody could attach
their own MCP server; that check is gone.

Ported from event-agent-ap so the concierge can wire the well-known cuga-apps MCP
servers just by naming them (``cuga_finance``, ``cuga_knowledge``, …). Scale-to-zero
on Code Engine → warm them before demos/tests. Stdlib-only apart from the logger.

UNDERSCORES, NOT HYPHENS, and this is the one naming rule worth stating. These names are
registry app names, and CUGA composes a tool identifier as ``<app>_<tool>`` — so a hyphen
would produce ``cuga-finance_get_crypto_price``, which the code-execution agent parses as
subtraction. This catalog used to spell them ``cuga-finance``, which forced a translation
step in the supervisor loader; that step is gone because the names now simply agree.
The Code Engine HOSTNAMES keep their hyphens (``cuga-apps-mcp-finance``) — they are DNS,
not identifiers, and _CODE_ENGINE below builds them from the bare suffix.
