"""The concierge — the NL→Flow COMPILER in front of THE one agent ("cuga").

SINGLE-AGENT WORLD (the events docs (plans/SUPERVISOR_REFACTOR.md)): the concierge does NO agent
routing — there is nothing to route between. Every hand-off and every flow targets ``cuga``
(a supervisor over YAML-defined sub-agents when EVENTS_SUPERVISOR=1, else the plain classic
agent). When an end user chats, the concierge:

  1. understands the intent (deterministic pre-router first — flowspec.py; LLM for ambiguity),
  2. immediate question → runs THE agent and returns the answer,
  3. STANDING request (schedule / watch / on-event) → compiles the TRIGGER (kind, source, event,
     slots — ask-till-legit), validates it against the registry, then REUSES a matching flow or
     CREATES one — always targeting ``cuga``,
  4. unknown trigger / missing slot → a QUESTION, never a broken flow.

Per-user integrations trigger a just-in-time **connect**: the concierge relays a login link
(CUGA hosts the OAuth; AP holds the token). Its meta-tools are host-bound.
