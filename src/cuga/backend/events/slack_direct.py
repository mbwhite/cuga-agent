"""Direct Slack integration — bypasses Activepieces.

Slack's own API takes the bot token (``xoxb-…``) directly, so we don't need AP's OAuth2 connection
(the wall that blocked the AP path) NOR the AP slack piece (whose app-event trigger silently ate the
payload). This is the DEFAULT Slack backend; the AP path stays behind ``EVENTS_SLACK_BACKEND=ap`` so
we can revisit that bug later.

Flow:  Slack Events API ▸ POST /api/events/slack/events (this module) ▸ /invoke(concierge) ▸
        chat.postMessage back to the channel.

Setup (Slack app at api.slack.com/apps):
  • Bot Token Scopes: chat:write, channels:history, channels:read (+ groups:history for private)
  • Event Subscriptions → Request URL = <EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL>/api/events/slack/events
    → subscribe bot event ``message.channels`` (+ ``message.groups`` for private)
  • Invite the bot to the channel.
Env: SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (required) · SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET (recommended — verifies requests are Slack's).
