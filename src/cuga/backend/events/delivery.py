"""Delivery backend selection — the single place that decides whether a channel's outbound
send is owned by **Activepieces** (an AP send-step appended to the flow) or by **CUGA itself**
(a direct adapter like ``slack_direct``).

Why this exists: Slack now delivers *directly* (bot token → chat.postMessage), bypassing AP — see
``slack_direct``. But a STANDING flow (cron/poll/push) that delivers to Slack used to always append
an AP send-step, which fails for a direct channel (there is no AP connection). This module closes
that gap: a scheduled/push flow whose sink is a *direct* channel keeps ``deliver=True`` (no AP send
step) and, when the fired run reaches ``/invoke``, CUGA sends the answer itself via ``send_direct``.

One knob per channel: ``EVENTS_<CHANNEL>_BACKEND`` (``direct`` | ``ap``). **All four channels now
default to ``direct``** — see ``_DEFAULT_BACKEND`` below, which is the authority. This paragraph
used to say telegram/discord defaulted to ``ap``; that stopped being true when ``telegram_direct``
and ``discord_direct`` landed, and a stale default here is the kind of thing that sends someone to
install Activepieces to fix a channel that already works.
