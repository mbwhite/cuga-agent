"""The ``AgentRuntime`` port — the single seam between the event plane and "an agent".

Everything agent-related (concierge, /invoke, channels) goes through this interface, so
swapping frameworks = writing one adapter (the events docs (ARCHITECTURE.md)). Implementations:

  - ``HttpRuntime``       — **the production one.** Executes by calling CUGA's ``POST /run``.
  - ``AgentStoreRuntime`` — its base: scope-keyed storage on the shared AgentStore, no execution.
  - ``ReactRuntime``      — LangGraph ``create_react_agent`` + ``MemorySaver`` (dev/test).
  - ``StubRuntime``       — deterministic, in-memory, **no deps** → tests & dry-run.

There is no in-process CUGA adapter any more: the eventing layer is a separate service, so the
worker call always crosses the wire. ReactRuntime imports langgraph **lazily inside methods**, so
importing this module never drags in a heavy runtime.

    events mounted onto CUGA's app and could reach its objects directly; with that gone they were
    unreachable, so they are gone too.

    ``cuga_url``/``cuga_token`` (http), ``model_factory``/``checkpointer`` (react).
