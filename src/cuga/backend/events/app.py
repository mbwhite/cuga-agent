"""FastAPI wiring for the events layer — registered onto the eventing service's own app.

Two new endpoints (the events docs (ARCHITECTURE.md)):
  - ``POST /invoke``         — the seam AP calls back through (X-Gateway-Token).
  - ``POST /api/concierge``  — NL → decide; ``?dry_run=1`` builds the flow without publishing.

``register_events_routes(app, runtime=..., store=...)`` is called from ``events/service.py`` — the
eventing service's OWN app. It is never called from CUGA's ``main.py``: the "combined" mode that
mounted these routes onto CUGA, and the ``EVENTS_ENABLED`` flag that gated it, are both gone.
Vanilla CUGA is untouched because it never imports this module at all.

        This is how a browser receives an asynchronous fire. A flow armed in the Studio chat or the
        main chat fires minutes or days later, with no request in flight — Slack would get a push,
        a tab can only be drained. So ``delivery.send_direct("web", …)`` writes the answer here and
        the chat surface polls this endpoint with the ``ts`` of the last message it rendered.

        ``since`` is EXCLUSIVE (pass back the last ``ts`` you saw and you will never re-render it).
        Pass ``since=0`` to get the thread's whole backlog — which is what a reloaded tab does, so
        the fires it missed while closed appear in the transcript rather than being lost.

        ``max_age`` (seconds) bounds that backlog on a FIRST load, and the cutoff is computed with
        the SERVER's clock. A minute-by-minute cron accumulates hundreds of fires; replaying all of
        them into a chat window is not "recovering what you missed", it is a flood. The clients ask
        for a day. It is a server-side parameter on purpose: the cursor is a server timestamp, so
        letting a browser subtract from its own clock would skip or repeat messages whenever the two
        disagree. Ignored once ``since`` is set, which is every poll after the first.

        A cron flow that runs at 09:00 is painful to test: you either wait, or re-arm it on a
        one-minute schedule. This fires the real flow immediately, through Activepieces, so the run
        exercises the real trigger→/invoke→sink chain with the real credentials.

        **This has real side effects.** The flow delivers wherever it was armed to deliver — it will
        post to your Slack channel, message your Telegram. It is not a dry run. Nothing about the run
        is marked as a test in Activepieces' own log.

        Whether the body you POST does anything depends on the flow's trigger:
          * SCHEDULE (cron/poll) — the /invoke body is frozen at arm time (agent, prompt, thread_id,
            scope), so the body is inert. It surfaces only as the run's trigger payload.
          * PUSH via a WEBHOOK-trigger piece (github) — the invoke body carries `{{trigger.<field>}}`
            templates, so the body you POST *becomes* the trigger output. Shape it like the piece's
            real trigger output and you exercise the watcher without opening a real pull request.

        NOT every flow can be fired this way. Verified 2026-07-10: the schedule piece and github's
        WEBHOOK trigger both run; gmail's `gmail_new_email_received` is an app-POLLING trigger, and AP
        accepts the trigger POST with 200 while producing no run at all. So a `timed_out` response on
        a gmail/box watcher means "this trigger type cannot be fired out of band", not "it is broken".
        Check the piece's trigger `type` at GET <AP>/api/v1/pieces/<piece>.

        ``?wait=0`` returns as soon as AP accepts the trigger. The default polls the run log for the
        run this call produced and returns its answer. Disable the endpoint entirely with

        """A generic inbound webhook: any external system (monitoring, CI, a form, a payment provider)
        POSTs a JSON payload to <EVENTS_PUBLIC_URL>/api/events/hook/<name> and CUGA runs an agent on it,
        optionally delivering the result to a channel.

        TWO WAYS to choose the agent — the whole point is you never have to guess wrong:

          * PINNED — ``?agent=<agent>`` (default ``incident_triage``). Deterministic: this exact agent
            handles every event. Right for a high-volume, known source (Datadog, Stripe) where you want
            one agent, one channel, fully observable. The caller must know the agent exists.

          * ROUTED — ``?route=1`` (aliases: ``true``/``yes``/``llm``/``concierge``). CUGA picks the
            best-fit agent the SAME WAY the chat concierge does for a Slack/web message: it lists the
            pre-built agents and routes by capability. The caller needs to know NOTHING about the agent
            catalog — rename or add agents and the URL never changes. It CANNOT ask a clarifying
            question (a webhook can't answer one), so if nothing fits it falls back to a generic triage
            rather than blocking. Costs one router pass per call; use PINNED for high firehose volume.

        Other query params: ?deliver_to=<channel> + ?target=<native id> (deliver the result to e.g. a
        Slack channel) · ?key=<secret> (required iff EVENTS_WEBHOOK_KEY is set).

        No AP — it reuses the /invoke seam. ROUTED is literally ``agent="concierge"`` on /invoke, the
        exact path an inbound channel message takes, so routing + delivery are shared with chat."""

        caller-controlled input — `body["scope"]`, a query param, or the X-User-Id header — and the
        bootstrap makes the default identity `admin`. So with a GATEWAY_TOKEN configured and

        created another admin: the caller simply asserted who they were and the role lookup agreed.
        The same path guards OAuth app configuration and connector credentials.

        Authorization cannot be the first gate — something has to establish WHO is calling before
        their roles mean anything. These routes are administrative, so they now take the same
        machine credential the rest of the events seams take, and fail closed without it.

        NOTE — this is a mitigation, not the end state. The Studio calls these routes from the
        browser, which holds no gateway token, so its admin screens need CUGA to proxy them (core
        has the token) or a real session. That is the "Studio has no login" item tracked
