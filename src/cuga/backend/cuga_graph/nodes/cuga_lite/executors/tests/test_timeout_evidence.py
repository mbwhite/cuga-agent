"""
Tests for timeout evidence preservation.

When a sandbox code block hits `sandbox_execution_timeout`, the agent used to
receive only a bare "Execution timed out" traceback: stdout printed before the
kill and the number of tool calls completed were discarded, so the agent's
usual response was to re-run the same doomed loop until the step limit.
`LocalExecutor.execute` now returns the partial stdout, the per-block
tool-call count (from `BlockToolCallCounter`), and restructuring guidance
instead.
