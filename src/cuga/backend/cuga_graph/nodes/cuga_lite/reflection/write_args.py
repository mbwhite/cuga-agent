"""Static analysis of the write arguments in a proposed code block.

VERIFY used to see only the source text, so a wrong value assigned to a
variable first became invisible to it: ``amount=share_per_person`` carries no
literal, and both the "ungrounded literal" and the "contradiction" rule are
written in terms of literals. This module resolves each write argument back to
the expression it will actually evaluate to, folding it to a constant when the
whole expression is constant, so the verifier compares values rather than
syntax.
