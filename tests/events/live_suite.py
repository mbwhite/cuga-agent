"""LIVE suite — the full behavioural sweep: NOW → channels → CRON → POLL → PUSH.

This is the "does the product work" test, as opposed to `live_e2e.py` ("does each surface work once")
and `live_matrix.py` ("is every mode × sink plumbed"). It exists to be run repeatedly while the known
gaps get fixed, so it distinguishes four outcomes rather than two:

    PASS   it worked, and we expected it to
    FAIL   it broke, and we expected it to work          ← the only thing that fails the run
    XFAIL  it broke, and we KNEW it would (a logged gap) ← expected; the reason is printed
    XPASS  it worked, but we expected it to break        ← a gap just closed. Update `expect`!

XPASS is deliberately loud. A suite whose expectations silently drift out of date is worse than no
suite, so when a known gap starts working the run tells you to delete the expectation.

PHASES
  now       every seeded agent, invoked DIRECTLY (no concierge, no channel) via the runonce envelope
  channels  the same probe over slack / discord / telegram, incl. a real Slack round trip
  cron      scheduled flows, mostly from the web endpoint, some armed from a channel
  poll      watch-on-change flows
  push      box · gmail · github integration watchers, plus the generic inbound webhook

THE NOW ENVELOPE. `source.type` accepts only `channel | integration | time`, so a channel-less direct
call to a named agent is `type: "time"` + `kind: "runonce"`. The response carries `meta.mcp` — the MCP
servers the agent actually reached — which we assert on, because "the answer contained a digit" does
not prove the agent used its tools rather than the model's memory.

Run:  make test-suite
      make test-suite ARGS="--only now"
      GITHUB_TEST_REPO=owner/repo make test-suite      # arms the github push row (creates a webhook)
