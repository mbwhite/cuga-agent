"""Every script that derives the repo root must actually land on the repo root.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Moving `scripts/` to `events/scripts/` put several files one
directory deeper. Each of them walks up a FIXED number of levels to find the repo root:

    cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."                  # bash
    pathlib.Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]   # python

A hard-coded climb is correct only for the depth it was written at. After the move every one of them
resolved to `events/` instead of the repo root, and the failure mode is the worst kind: `events_up.sh`
exited 2 with an EMPTY log, `make reload` printed nothing, and both services just never came up.
Nothing in CI noticed, because CI runs pytest and never executes a shell script.

The check is trivial — climb, then look for `pyproject.toml` — but it is the only thing standing
between a future `git mv` and another silent-exit debugging session.
