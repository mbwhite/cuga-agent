"""Build an agent from nothing — no roster, no seed, no `cuga_*` server.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every other agent in the suite comes from a shipped roster (pricebot,
geobot, pr_reviewer …) or the seed set, and all of them use the built-in `cuga_*` MCP servers. A
suite made only of those can pass while the product is quietly unusable by anyone whose agents are
not ours — it would not have caught the MCP allow-list, which rejected any server outside the
built-in seven and so made "bring your own" impossible.

So everything here is deliberately foreign: an invented agent name, an invented MCP server, an
invented tool. If this file passes, somebody starting from an empty deployment can build a working
agent, which is the property the roster-based tests cannot demonstrate.

Uses the REAL AgentStore rather than a fake, so persistence is exercised too.
